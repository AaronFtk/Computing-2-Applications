# Recursion - Tutorial
A recursive function is a function that calls itself (either directly or indirectly).
This is a very powerful programming technique in which a problem will be divided into
a set of similar subproblems, each solved with a trival solution.
Let's jump into the example of the famous Towers of Hanoi puzzle:
> The Tower consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod.
