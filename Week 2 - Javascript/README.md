# Week 2 #
## Tuesday ##
This week we will start off getting accustomed to Javascript,
some of the tooling, and similarities and differences from Python
that you will have seen in Computing 1.

There are three tasks to do for the Wednesday tutorial session.
1. Complete your workspace set-up from last week.
2. Open `server.js` in the `web-app` folder and complete the exercises.
3. Open `c1-exam.js` and complete the exercises - this is an adaption of Q6 of the Computing 1 exam by Becky Steward @TheLeadingZero.
