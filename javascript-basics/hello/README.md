# Welcome to the Exercise for JS Basics

## hello
In this exercise, you will be able to learn how to run your programme in the debug console.
Then you are able to write your own functions, and send greetings with regard to your input.

***Step 1:Go to your hello.js file. Press Fn+F5 or go to > Run > Start Debugging***

***Step 4***: Replace the filler code with your own so when the programme is running, you will see `"Hello World!"` in your debug console.

## greetings
In this exercise, you are going to write more complex functions.
You will need to learn the basic [flow control]() in JavaScript yourseleves in order to finish the tasks.
Then you are going to export the function for your next task.

## greetingBot

Great job! Now let's get our hands sweatier by importing the `greeting` module. 
Understanding that `function` in JavaScript is a really a first-class Object is important.
You may be surprised to find out the `getWater()` function could be passed as a parameter for
the greetingBot but this is no big surprise for the Bot ~
